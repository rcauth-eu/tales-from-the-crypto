Timber! - append-only logging with "blocktrees."

The following code was written for a talk given on RFC 6962 "blocktrees",
14 Oct 2016.  However, it uses a cryptographically weaker checksum because
it was written for demonstration purposes - it would be quite simple to
replace it with a stronger checksum.

How to compile:
	gcc -Wall -o timber timber.c -lz

How to run:
	./timber words
where 'words' is a file with words in it, one per line.

The code is used only for teaching purposes, so the tree has only words in
it, rather than certificates or certificate requests, and there are no signatures.
The purpose is to repurpose the "blocktrees" and study what else they can do,
rather than provide a full implementation of RFC 6962.
