# This code is designed to regenerate a private key from a public key
# and one of the primes.  The purpose of this approach is that sometimes one
# needs to back up or transport a private key in a secure way, and it can
# be useful to minimise the number of bytes that need to be transferred.

# Python functions are very version dependent but this was written
# with Python 3.5 and might work with everything >= 3.2.
#
# This code is designed specifically to be a single file script with
# no external dependencies other than Python and the standard library.
# This is because it is designed to work on offline systems, with a
# read-only filesystem, so cannot rely on the usual tricks of having
# to pull in external dependencies.
#
# The current implementation contains more code than it strictly needs
# to perform the core task of converting between
# {pubkey,prime}<->{privkey}
#
# Although largely a spare time project, the work presented here was
